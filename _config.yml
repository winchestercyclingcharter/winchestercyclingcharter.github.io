  Getting more people to cycle can make a significant contribution to tackling 
  many of the problems facing our city – congestion, air pollution, obesity, 
  mental health issues, poor quality of life – whilst also providing an 
  economic stimulus that revitalises Winchester and helps it towards a more 
  vibrant future.
