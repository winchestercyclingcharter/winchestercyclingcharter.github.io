### Why should Winchester enable more people to cycle?

Enabling cycling will help Winchester tackle its challenges of pollution, 
congestion and unhealthy lifestyles.

A comprehensive, convenient and connected network of cycle infrastructure 
enables people to choose cycling as the safe, natural choice for a large 
proportion of everyday journeys. This frees up road space for essential car 
journeys.

Making our city more appealing for cycling and all types of active travel 
creates a more attractive place to live, work and visit. It can provide an 
economic stimulus and a pathway to a more vibrant future.

### What is the Winchester Cycling Charter?

The Winchester Cycling Charter is a simple statement of support for ‘cycling’ as the means of making Winchester a better city.

It outlines the benefits cycling can bring to our city and is something that businesses, schools, the health sector, shops and individuals can readily support.

The Charter enables organisations across the city to express their support for cycling, showing they understand that cycling is good for business, good for our health, good for the economy and builds a better city for us to live in.

Charter signatories demonstrate to Winchester and Hampshire’s leaders that there is wide support for cycling and a growing consensus for investment in better cycling infrastructure.

### Why doesn’t the Charter talk about segregated infrastructure, reducing traffic, filtered permeability and other cycling infrastructure solutions?

The Charter is about the principle of enabling cycling rather than the specific road design solutions.

The wording deliberately stays away from stating specific design or policy measures that will get people to cycle (e.g. segregated paths).  These design discussions will come later when engaging with Council Officers and Councillors.

### Is the Charter anti-car?

No. The charter isn’t anti-anything. The charter is pro-cycling. It calls for a change in spending priorities so that more money is used to support and encourage people to ride bikes.

Organisations and individuals who sign the charter will represent a broad range of opinions. The charter aims to articulate the middle ground, a vision for cycling which the majority of people can get behind.


### Is the Charter just for businesses or can individuals support it too?

Individuals are encouraged to support the Charter.

The Charter was created to enable businesses / organisations to show their support for cycling.  Organisations can range from large employers in the city, businesses, shops, schools, colleges, health practices, gyms, churches, youth clubs, emergency services.

### By signing the Charter are organisations showing support for Cycle Winchester?

No.  We recognise that many organisations will be happy to support a call for better cycling provision without needing to align themselves with Cycle Winchester.

### Will the organisations who support the Charter be made public?

Yes.  The purpose is to enable organisations to visibly support the Charter’s aims.   Organisations may also wish to issue a press release and Tweet to express their support for the Charter.

The Charter will echo many organisations’ sustainability policies and we anticipate most organisations will welcome the opportunity to publicly support this initiative.
