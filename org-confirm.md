Your organisation's name and web link will appear on our [supporters](/supporters) page within 24 hours. We'd also like to add your organisation's logo. Please

On receipt, we'll add your logo to our [supporters](/supporters) page. 

In return, we will send you a Charter Mark in the form of a banner image to display on your website, or an A4 PDF to print and display at your premises.

### Other ways your organisation can help

You might consider issuing a press release announcing that your organisation
is supporting the Winchester Cycling Charter. We'd be delighted to help with draft text. Drop us an email at [info@winchestercyclingcharter.org.uk](mailto:info@winchestercyclingcharter.org.uk).

Does your workplace want to attract and keep the best talent by making commuting by bike easier and stress-free? By integrating cycling into your business in a positive and simple way, you could achieve the accolade of Cycle Friendly Employer accreditation. Full details from [Cycling UK](https://www.cyclinguk.org/cycle-friendly-employer).

Perhaps you are interested in operating a cycle-to-work scheme for your employees? Employees can save 25-40% of the price of a new bike, paying by salary sacrifice. Department for Transport lays out the [terms of the scheme here](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/cycle-to-work-scheme-implementation-guidance), and [several intermediary companies](https://www.google.com/search?q=cycle+to+work+scheme+uk) offer to help with scheme implementation.
